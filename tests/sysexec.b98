This program should ouput (on a POSIX system):
	Hi there (and now a ls):
	<list of files in current directory, as ls outputs it>

	Retval (should be 0): 0
	Will run: exit 2

	Retval (should be 2): 2
There should be no indention in the output. (It was done here to it clear this
line is not part of the output.)
The blank lines should match.
