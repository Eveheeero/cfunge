This program should draw a pattern like below.
The * is a dot.
The horizontal (black) line should be 25 units long.
	There should be a gap 2/3rd along the line of 2 units.
Then a red line (5 units long) at a straight angle.
	The specs doesn't say if 90 degrees is upwards or downwards. So either is
	allowed.
	The red should be (#ff0001) (a slight slight green tint).
Then another (black) line of length 5 at straight angle.
	This should be 90 degrees *right* from the red line.
The dot (black) should be 5 units above the vertical line.
	Or below, depending on where 90 degrees is.

                         *
