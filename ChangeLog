Development version (r344)
--------------------------
These are important changes since last release:
 * Fixed a few bugs in loading code.
 * Added support for showing top 5 elements on the stack when tracing.
 * Fixed several bugs in StackPreallocSpace() that resulted in crashes later on.
 * Added a man page.
 * Imported two new libraries into the code:
   genx - An XML output library (used by TURT).
   stringbuffer - Some utilities to build strings in an easy way, code was taken
                  from crossfire.
 * Some work on Funge-108 features:
   * y now works as it should.
   * k handles ; as in Funge-108 (was undef in Funge-98).
 * Made & and ~ handle EOF correctly.
 * Made several fingerprints use stringbuffer, making their code much simpler.
 * New macro StackFreeString() to make handling Boehm-GC quirk easier.
 * Update of fingerprint spec format, some preliminary support for Funge-108
   style fingerprints.
 * New library dependency: due to TERM cfunge now needs ncurses.
 * Fixed Form Feed handling.
 * Made k on k work.
 * Fixed broken k (mycology was wrong about how to interpret it).
 * Fixed number of ticks spaces in strings took in concurrent Funge.
 * Fixed "jump to next instruction" in Funge-108 in 0k.
 * Several Funge-108 fixes in y command.
 * Various typo fixes.
 * Clean up the mess in loading code by using mmap() to read files.
 * Mycology was wrong about "y as pick" behaviour, fixed cfunge to conform to
   the standard.

Added fingerprints:
 * FING Operate on single fingerprint semantics
 * FRTH Some common forth commands
 * STRN String functions
 * TERM Terminal control functions

Changes to fingerprints:
 * Fixed many bugs in TURT.
 * FILE got extended with the instruction D, added it.
 * Removed PNTR, it was a deprecated alias for INDV.
 * Certain JSTR and STRN instruction are now relative storage offset.


0.2.1-pre2
----------
Important changes in this release:
 * Speedup in pushing strings on stack.
 * Aliases for fingerprints supported (spec fileformat changed).
 * Added doxygen documentation for API exposed to fingerprints.
 * To help C-INTERCAL add a FungeSpaceLoadString()

Added fingerprints:
 * FILE File I/O functions
 * INDV Pointer functions
 * JSTR Read and write strings in Funge-Space
 * PNTR Alias for INDV
 * TIME Time and Date functions
 * TURT Simple Turtle Graphics Library


0.2.1-pre1
----------
Important changes in this release:
 * Support for the (optional) i, o and = instructions.
 * Internal API was cleaned up to be more consistent with itself.
 * Fix some places were cfunge wasn't 100% standard conforming.
   (Note that mycology didn't detect these issues.)
 * Some fixes for bugs that caused crashes.
 * A lot of less serious bugs were fixed.
 * Some code were optimised (including the hash library).
 * And some added fingerprints.

Added fingerprints:
 * CPLI Complex Integer extension
 * FIXP Some useful math functions
 * FPDP Double precision floating point
 * FPSP Single precision floating point
 * HRTI High-Resolution Timer Interface
 * PERL Generic Interface to the Perl Language (not available in sandbox mode)
 * TOYS Funge-98 Standard Toys


0.2.0
-----
This release adds fingerprint support (along with several fingerprints),
concurrency, a lot of bug fixes and implementing missing features.

Added fingerprints:
 * BASE I/O for numbers in other bases
 * DIRF Directory functions extension (not available in sandbox mode)
 * MODU Modulo Arithmetic Extension
 * NULL Funge-98 Null Fingerprint
 * ORTH Orthogonal Easement Library
 * REFC Referenced Cells Extension
 * ROMA Funge-98 Roman Numerals
 * SUBR Subroutine extension


0.1.0
-----
Initial release. Had basic support for what is required in Befunge98 standard.
