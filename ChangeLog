Changes since last release (r455)
---------------------------------
These are important changes since last release:
 * Fixed off by one in TIME.
 * Made STRN use the global input buffer.
 * Fixed alignment bugs in several of the test programs.
 * Handle some cases of failed malloc() better.
 * Reduced memory usage by fixing an over-allocation in hash library code.
 * Removed some GNU LD specific linker flags to make the code link with other
   linkers.
 * Changed to use memcpy() to duplicate stack.
 * Added missing free() on some error code paths.
 * SCKE now use getaddrinfo() instead of the obsolete gethostbyname().
 * Changed some often accessed bitfields to full bools.
 * Funge-Space now use memory pools for allocation. This reduces memory
   fragmentation and also malloc bookkeeping overhead. It is also slightly
   faster.
 * Added valgrind annotations for the memory pools as a compile time option.
   If enabled this slows down the code by several orders of magnitude, but is
   useful for debugging.
 * Major changes to function names, they now use _ instead of CamelCase.
 * Fixed various build system bugs.
 * Major speed improvement in mycology, flushing output less often.
 * Strings in cfunge are now mostly unsigned.
 * Reading a file with i is now unsigned.
 * STDIO is now unsigned.
 * Removed kdevelop project files.


0.3.2
-----
These are important changes since last release:
 * Fix small bug in K in SOCK causing the instruction to fail if the socket
   wasn't connected.
 * Add checks for some long double math.h functions that didn't exist on
   FreeBSD. Fall back on double versions.
 * Support cygwin a bit better.
 * Update FING to match updated specs.


0.3.1
-----
These are important changes since last release:
 * Code now use memcpy() to copy IP for t, then deep copy of the remaining
   elements.
 * Fixed crash with nested k instructions on t.
 * Fixed build system to work with other compilers than GCC (the C code already
   did work).
 * Fixed a lot of small issues detected with compiler warnings of the other
   compilers (like %zu when it should have been %zd in format string).
 * Fixed a single precision function call that should have used the double
   precision variant in FPDP.
 * Fixed off by one error in validation of handles in SOCK and FILE.
 * Made tools/fuzz-test.sh work on other systems.
 * Made build-man work for out of tree builds.
 * When using GC do not use ec (extensible cords). It caused segfault...

Added fingerprints:
 * SCKE TCP/IP async socket and dns resolving extension
 * SOCK TCP/IP socket extension


0.3.0
-----
Important changes in this release:
 * Fixed a few bugs in loading code.
 * Added support for showing top 5 elements on the stack when tracing.
 * Fixed several bugs in StackPreallocSpace() that resulted in crashes later on.
 * Added a man page.
 * Imported two new libraries into the code:
   genx - An XML output library (used by TURT).
   stringbuffer - Some utilities to build strings in an easy way, code was taken
                  from crossfire.
 * Some work on Funge-108 features:
   * y now works as it should.
   * k handles ; as in Funge-108 (was undef in Funge-98).
 * Made & and ~ handle EOF correctly.
 * Made several fingerprints use stringbuffer, making their code much simpler.
 * New macro StackFreeString() to make handling Boehm-GC quirk easier.
 * Update of fingerprint spec format, some preliminary support for Funge-108
   style fingerprints.
 * New library dependency: due to TERM cfunge now needs ncurses.
 * Fixed Form Feed handling.
 * Made k on k work.
 * Fixed broken k (mycology was wrong about how to interpret it).
 * Fixed number of ticks spaces in strings took in concurrent Funge.
 * Fixed "jump to next instruction" in Funge-108 in 0k.
 * Several Funge-108 fixes in y command.
 * Various typo fixes.
 * Clean up the mess in loading code by using mmap() to read files.
 * Mycology was wrong about "y as pick" behaviour, fixed cfunge to conform to
   the standard.
 * Refactor Funge-Space loading code.
 * Fix bug with setting initial least point at loading.
 * Major renaming of types:
   * Renamed FUNGEDATATYPE to fungeCell.
   * Dropped FUNGEVECTORTYPE (use fungeCell instead).
   * Dropped fungePosition (use fungeVector instead).
   * FUNGEDATA*PRI for printf renamed to FUNGECELL*PRI.

Added fingerprints:
 * 3DSP 3D space manipulation extension
 * FING Operate on single fingerprint semantics
 * FRTH Some common forth commands
 * REXP Regular Expression Matching
 * STRN String functions
 * TERM Terminal control functions

Changes to fingerprints:
 * Fixed many bugs in TURT.
 * FILE got extended with the instruction D, added it.
 * Removed PNTR, it was a deprecated alias for INDV.
 * INDV instructions are now relative storage offset.
 * Certain JSTR and STRN instruction are now relative storage offset.

There was no 0.2.1, it got turned into 0.3.0.


0.2.1-pre2
----------
Important changes in this release:
 * Speedup in pushing strings on stack.
 * Aliases for fingerprints supported (spec fileformat changed).
 * Added doxygen documentation for API exposed to fingerprints.
 * To help C-INTERCAL add a FungeSpaceLoadString()

Added fingerprints:
 * FILE File I/O functions
 * INDV Pointer functions
 * JSTR Read and write strings in Funge-Space
 * PNTR Alias for INDV
 * TIME Time and Date functions
 * TURT Simple Turtle Graphics Library


0.2.1-pre1
----------
Important changes in this release:
 * Support for the (optional) i, o and = instructions.
 * Internal API was cleaned up to be more consistent with itself.
 * Fix some places were cfunge wasn't 100% standard conforming.
   (Note that mycology didn't detect these issues.)
 * Some fixes for bugs that caused crashes.
 * A lot of less serious bugs were fixed.
 * Some code were optimised (including the hash library).
 * And some added fingerprints.
