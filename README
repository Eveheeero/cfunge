This is cfunge08 a fast Beunge93/98/08 interpreter in C.

You will need Boehm-GC (http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/)
version 7 or later installed to run or compile this software.

Further you will need cmake (http://www.cmake.org/) to compile it.

Fingerprints:
It is planned to implement most or all of the existing fingerprints,
with some exceptions:
 * FNGR - Contradicts with 98 standard.
 * TRDS - Exceedingly complex and intrusive.
 * MODE - Intrusive into IP handling.
 * WIND - Too complex to implement.
