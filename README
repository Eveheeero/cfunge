This is cfunge08 a fast Beunge93/98/08 interpreter in C.

You will need Boehm-GC (http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/) version
7 or later installed to run or compile this software. If you lack it you could
try building without garbage collector but IT IS UNSUPPORTED. If you still want
to try, enable LEAK_MODE option in cmake. If a bug only happens in this mode,
it probably won't get fixed.

Further you will need cmake (http://www.cmake.org/) to compile it.

Fingerprints:
It is planned to implement most or all of the existing fingerprints,
with some exceptions:
 * FNGR - Contradicts with 98 standard.
 * TRDS - Exceedingly complex and intrusive.
 * MODE - Intrusive into IP handling.
 * WIND - Too complex to implement.
 * IMAP - Too intrusive.

The Befunge98 standard leaves some things undefined, here is what we do for
some of those cases:
* y pushes time in UTC not local time.
* k with a negative argument reflects.
* # across edge of funge space may or may not skip first char
  after wrapping depending on exact situation.
* ( and ) with a negative count reflects and doesn't pop any fingerprint.
