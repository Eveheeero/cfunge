In this file is a list of API changes that caused API to increment:

Version 1
---------
  Initial version, external API was not versioned before this.


Version 2
---------
Main breaking change was changing prototype of fungespace_load_string from
  void fungespace_load_string(const unsigned char * restrict program);
to
  void fungespace_load_string(const unsigned char * restrict program,
                              size_t length);

The parameter "length" should be like taking a strlen() on the program parameter
(if program contains no embedded null-bytes). However as long as length is
correct the code can handle embedded null bytes.
