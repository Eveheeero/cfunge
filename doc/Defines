For development purposes there are some specialised defines. These should
not be used unless you are doing development on cfunge. If you don't know
that you want one of these, then you don't.

None of these is accessible as simple options in cmake. Some of these
requires customised built systems to work (such as the klee ones).

CFUN_KLEE_TEST           Define if you are going to test cfunge using klee.
CFUN_KLEE_TEST_PROGRAM   Define to test random programs using klee.
CFUN_PARANOIA            Enable extra asserts. Note that CFUN_KLEE_TEST
                         implies this.
FUZZ_TESTING             Has to be defined to use tools/fuzz-test.sh.
