This file details current status of the Befunge93/98/108 interpreter cfunge.

Before next release
-------------------
 * Make a man page
 * Test

Future
------
Things that will be supported but aren't yet:
 * For i: Check that binary mode works
 * Several more fingerprints

Ideas:
 * Make trace interface better, possibly make it interface with some sort of
   debugger (like the one of CCBI but better).
