Before next release
-------------------

   * TURT:
     * Test adding dots after lines in all cases. Some may not work correctly.
   * For i: Check that binary mode works

Future
------
 * Several more fingerprints
 * Better hash library.

Ideas for future
----------------
 * Make trace interface better, possibly make it interface with some sort of
   debugger (like the one of CCBI but better).
